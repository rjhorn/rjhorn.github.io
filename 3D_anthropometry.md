## 3D Anthropometry for Patients With High Body Mass

While working as an undergraduate researcher in the [Biosciences Group](https://www.umtri.umich.edu/research/groups/biosciences/) at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute, I contributed to a project assessing the three-dimensional anthropometry of patients with high body mass. The project aimed to develop a database quantifying the body shape of high body mass patients in functional positions relevant for medical devices. I assisted with literature review, subject data collections using full-body laser scanning and traditional anthropometry methods, and anatomical landmark extraction in Meshlab software. I presented my findings at the Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program symposium and contributed to a publication titled, [“Development of Three-Dimensional Anthropometry Methods for Patients with High Body Mass Index”](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1541931213601240?casa_token=L4RYitqmNIcAAAAA:FxNtQPb7yOTXrSigraf0_n9gm3UPBL_CFmVHZcFcim9ekqBcSlDslf2N6bjOT_P2-vLOuxIoeckT).
