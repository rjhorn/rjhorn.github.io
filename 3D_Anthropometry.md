## 3D Anthropometry for Patients With High Body Mass/ project page

**Hello!** I'm a research scientist with a background in biomechanics and neuromotor control. As a biomechanist, I strive to apply my scientific curiosity and data-driven approach to practical applications. My current interests include exploring wearable devices, biological signals, and biomechanical imaging. I enjoy expanding my biomechanical toolbox through learning new data collection techniques and research software. In my free time, I like to apply my creative energy towards music production, writing, and learning new things. I also love running, disc golfing, and playing games with friends.

### 1. Suggest hypotheses about the causes of observed phenomena

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Assess assumptions on which statistical inference will be based

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Support the selection of appropriate statistical tools and techniques
