## Stone Research Foundation

As a Research Associate at the Stone Research Foundation, I managed research study operations, including patient recruitment and consent, scheduling MRIs and blood draws, database management, and IRB applications and modifications, while working closely with collaborating scientists. Additionally, I coordinated grant applications, including coordination of deliverables with collaborators, preparing documents with team members, while meeting time-sensitive deadlines. I also communicated research findings by preparing abstracts and presentations for multiple conferences.
