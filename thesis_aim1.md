## Somatosensation and postural control across the life span

My thesis during my masterâ€™s program investigated the relationship between 
somatosensation and postural control in individuals across the lifespan. 
I conducted this thesis under the guidance of Dr. Stacey Meardon and 
Dr. Chia-Cheng Lin. The project had multiple aims, including establishing 
normative values of tactile somatosensation for adults from the ages 25-85, 
identifying the measurement locations most relevant for postural control, 
and exploring the relationship between tactile somatosensation for predicting 
postural control outcomes. You can read the description of my thesis in the 
document below.
