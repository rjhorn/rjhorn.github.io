      <h2 id="somatosensation-and-postural-control-across-the-life-span">Somatosensation and postural control across the life span</h2>

<p>My thesis during my master’s program investigated the relationship between somatosensation and postural control in individuals across the lifespan. I conducted this thesis under the guidance of Dr. Stacey Meardon and Dr. Chia-Cheng Lin. The project had multiple aims, including establishing normative values of tactile somatosensation for adults from the ages 25-85, identifying the measurement locations most relevant for postural control, and exploring the relationship between tactile somatosensation for predicting postural control outcomes. You can read the description of my thesis in the document below. A more substantial summary of my thesis will be added to my website soon.</p>
